Trying out that encumberance sheet -> there's definitely some tabletime spent with everyone figuring out what they're carrying, which I expected. Going somewhere like Prospero's Dream actually helps a little bit, as no one was trying to sneak their laser cutter / bomb past a Q-Team. So an environment outlawing certain items freed my players up a bit? Made it so they had 1-2 fewer things to choose between, which helped. 

(My headcannon for the system is that short range comms is a wearable item, like the flashlight. People not in a vacc suit or armor can wear 1-2 things. Practically, they often pick short-range comms so one sneaky scouter can relay stuff to the others in real time. Personally I vastly prefer this dynamic - everyone knows what is going on, so things can go faster.)

The encumberance sheet means that when they did get ambushed by some hunglungs w/ spears and drove them off, they had some choices to make about what loot to carry along. 5 spears, 2 hazard env suits that weren't ruined, a flare gun and an IR monocle are suddenly something to deliberate over, which is perfect for being suddenly dumped into the Sink. All that stuff in their stash is also a world away. I'm definitely going to keep using encumberance and fan it out to my other games. 

This table might have things on easy mode a tiny bit, as they already have a very loyal Android mercenary who's basically a blander Bishop following them around. I expect him to start getting to carry some extra bits of gear around. What can I say, it's my niece and nephew. Also I figured by now one of them would be playing the android due to a character death.
