writeup physical game nights 1 and 2

Marine with examination loadout - WHooooo that is a real warning sign. Don't fear the scientist, fear the marine with this gear, for they will be a butcher of all things.

It's Friend's Nighttime Delivery - Geoff, Jeff the Teamster, and Steaksauce the Android driving an A-6 Grizzly from Bixby to Lyons, a strange box in the cargo hold.

Session 2 - Sara's knocked out in the cargo hold, Roland pins Geoff's arms to his side. Steaksauce is driving away from the God, Jeff is watching it in the turret through his IR goggles. Jeff, hearing Geoff struggle, slides down the ladder and runs behind Roland, hitting him with his crowbar. Roland, distracted, let off some pressure on Geoff, who struggled free and levered up his stun baton but missed. Steaksauce, listening into comms from the driver's cockpit, slammed the brakes and only Geoff remained standing, who snatched up some stowing rope and struggled against Roland to tie up his hands. Roland stood and launched himself at Jeff, headbutting him and biting him. Geoff failed to trigger his stun baton optimally - eventually Steaksauce briefly halted the vehicle, ran back to tranq Roland, and sprinted back to the cockpit to drive the ATV away.

The android drove adroitly and speedily through multiple opposed checks, and the God was soon lost in the desert night behind them.

They bent to the task of understanding Roland. Between a bioscanner, a medscanner, a cybernetic organism scanner, and their electronic toolkit, they deduced that the God might be broadcasting and receiving data from Roland, and it was so. Roland's cyberbrain prosthetics were doing this, as were the burnt-looking black marks upon his scalp.

Sara woke up and as usual, seems to roll well. She asked them why they were studying Roland's body rather than dumping it, if it was dangerous. She indicated that it wasn't Roland anymore. She seemed distant, as though she were in a dream.

They rolled up on a curve in the road, boxed in somewhat by somewhat steep sides. Boulders on either shoulder. The road itself had a patch that was carved up as though by a laser cutter. Jeff threw a box of twinkies at it from the pallet, to no effect. Geoff knew from his military training that mine triggers are set to weights close to what they are designed to attack - an anti-vehicle mine won't go off from a 5 pound weight. He crept close and noticed detonator pressure sensors and mines or IEDs wedged into the road carvings. Steaksauce drove the ATV around, critically succeeding and thereby running over an android hiding under camo blankets near one of the boulders. 

They came up to a parked Grizzly, and watched as a rubber-faced android climbed into the turret and pointed a pulse rifle at them. It told them to turn off their engines and dismount. Steaksauce locked all external doors and came in the back to scheme. The android promised them shelter, and that it was not familiar with the God of Route 11b, and the party was not convinced, rightly. They decided to dump Roland out the back and see what the Android does with him. Sara does not deign to watch this but otherwise does not try to stop them. As they roll up the backdoor, they spot another 2 androids in the distance, behind boulders, aiming weapons at them. They throw Roland out and slam the cargo door shut as pulse rifle rounds impact off it. 

The android on the radio calls them. 'We tire of this. Step out of your vehicle, it is time to meet God.'

I figure the next session starts with a panic check. They were very convinced androids would not be turned by the God as Roland was.
