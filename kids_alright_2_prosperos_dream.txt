So the niece/nephew/brother-in-law/android merc squad dock just outside Prospero's Dream, because their 93 Hull mining vessel will not fit in the dry dock. They lose some stress from getting back to civilization, and then the Q-Team pointing pulse rifles at them and hosing them down with disinfectant stresses them out again. They head through the dry docks, down a corridor towards the Stellar Burn to buy drinks, look for weapons, and offload their cargo.

My first encounter roll is a deadly one. I roll an 8. I ask them who's in front of the group. Ryan's up front, and fails a Body save. The group (I rule) has blundered into a section of walkway that irises open and they tumble down a chrome-slick peristalting gullet. When they awaken they're on a plateau of broken concrete. In the distance they see what looks dimly like a waterfall, with a few flickering yellow lights. Above them cold blue lights shine constantly like stars. Cracked buildings lean drunkenly and in the distance a vast series of pipes seems to be both still and writhing. (In retrospect I should've had them roll a fear save or panic save but I was so flummoxed by them taking the Hell Slide to the Sink that I was just trying to give them some semi-viable choice of direction). Everything is dim to dark, the air is cold and incredibly thin. They manage to find an old O2 bottle with 6 hours of breathe left to it. Taking stock, they march towards the waterfall. 

They wind up in a canyon formed of two collossal buildings leaning against one another, an alley between them turned into a small steep ravine. Willow asks if she can see anything with her IR goggles, and I tell her there are dim handprints on one of the empty window-panes.

So at the base of the buildings there's a shelf of concrete about as wide as a sidewalk, then the ravine.
